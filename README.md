# Memory Game Project

## How the Game Works
The memory game consists of sixteen cards. The cards are arranged randomly on the board with the symbol face down. 
The gameplay rules are:
  - The players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match.
  - If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
  - If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
